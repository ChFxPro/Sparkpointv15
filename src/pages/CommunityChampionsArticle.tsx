              It started with a question: How do we honor a year of recovery without losing sight of the work that remains? The answer wasn’t in the programming. It was in the people who stood at the gates.

              On September 27, 2025, the air at Brevard Music Center felt heavy with memory but light with presence. A year had passed since Hurricane Helene reshaped our landscape, and while the physical scars on the mountains were healing, the human story was still being written.
            </p>
            <p>
              We expected a crowd. What we didn’t fully anticipate was the spirit in which they would arrive. From the moment the gates opened, the atmosphere wasn’t one of spectacle, but of reunion. And the first faces they saw weren’t staff or security—they were neighbors.

              Dozens of volunteers stepped forward to steward this space. They directed parking with patience, handed out programs with genuine warmth, and simply stood present as hundreds of residents gathered on the lawn.

              In a year defined by rebuilding, the act of showing up for one another has become a quiet rhythm in Transylvania County. It’s no longer about emergency response; it’s about the sustained, often invisible work of holding space.

              Throughout the evening, we watched these champions move through the crowd. They weren’t looking for recognition. They were looking for gaps—someone who needed a chair, a family looking for a spot on the grass, a neighbor who just needed a hand to hold.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is what community infrastructure looks like in practice. It isn't just systems and funding; it is the willingness of individuals to extend themselves for the comfort of a stranger.
