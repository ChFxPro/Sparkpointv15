      <p>Happy New Year! Welcome back to Echoes from the Community, a column that shares insights from real stories told by residents across Transylvania County, collected through SparkPoint, a local nonprofit dedicated to strengthening community connections and well-being.</p>
      <p>As the new year begins, many of us are thinking about fresh starts. We often set goals, make plans, and look ahead. But before moving forward, it is important to reflect on the year behind us.</p>
      <p>During 2025, many neighbors across Transylvania County have shared stories from their lives through Echoes from the Community, offering insight into how connected, or disconnected, they have felt and what has mattered most during moments of challenge and change. If there is one thing we've learned through this, it's that connection changes everything.</p>
      <p>One person shared how, during a difficult season of mental health challenges, the most meaningful support they received was not advice or solutions, but someone who consistently listened. That simple act of being heard helped restore a sense of hope. Another story described an unexpected reconciliation between neighbors, sparked by a simple holiday greeting that opened the door to understanding and mutual care. What changed was not the situation, but the decision to reach out.</p>
      <p>Across many stories, similar themes emerge. Neighbors from across the county, including Brevard, Rosman, Cedar Mountain, Pisgah Forest, Connestee Falls, Little River, and Schenck Job Corps have shared their stories.</p>
      <p>Some shared they feel deeply connected to their community, while others expressed feeling isolated or unheard. Together, these voices reflect a community that values connection, even as we continue to learn how to practice it more intentionally.</p>
      <p>As we step into a new year, these echoes invite us to consider connection as something we build daily. It grows through small choices: checking in, listening fully, and noticing the people around us.</p>
      <p>Echoes from the Community encourages you to reflect on this question:</p>
      <p class="font-serif italic text-lg border-l-4 border-[#E03694] pl-4 my-6">When was the last time you felt genuinely connected to someone, and why did it happen? Maybe it came from being vulnerable, opening yourself to a new idea, or listening without the need to respond. However it showed up, what would it look like to practice it again?</p>
      <p>Share your experience online and tag SparkPoint using #YearOfConnection to be highlighted on our socials!</p>
      <p>Echoes from the Community will continue to share stories like these, highlighting what residents are saying, why it matters, and how these insights are guiding efforts to build a more connected and compassionate Transylvania County.

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Kindness After the Storm</h3>
      <p>Welcome back to Echoes from the Community, a column that shares insights from real stories told by residents across Transylvania County, collected through SparkPoint, a local nonprofit dedicated to strengthening community connections and well-being.</p>
      <p>In many stories collected after Hurricane Helene, people often spoke about rebuilding homes, clearing roads, or replacing what was lost. But a pattern that continuously showed up was much deeper than physical destruction. What comes after the storm, more than anything else, is kindness.</p>
      <p>Many residents shared stories that revealed a common need to be seen, understood, and met with gentleness.</p>
      <p>One community member reflected that after experiencing the hurricane, we could learn that "Instead of being upset with a person, it's likely that they just don't know. For the most part, people are good. They don't know what they don't know."</p>
      <p>Another explained, "Learning how to listen is the only way to communicate effectively."</p>
      <p>These quotes reinforce that feeling seen and understood begins with someone slowing down long enough to truly listen, which is one of the gentlest acts we can offer. And when we choose to listen, we also choose to care about what another person has to say. That care, whether it looks like offering help before being asked, giving someone grace on a hard day, or simply showing up with patience, is the heart of kindness that carried this community through the storm. It is also the same kindness that can guide us long after the storm has passed, in our everyday lives.</p>
      <p>As residents across the county reminded us, kindness is not just something that appears in moments of crisis. It is something we can practice every day. If Hurricane Helene revealed anything, it's that kindness is our strongest form of resilience and the foundation for whatever comes next.</p>
      <p>Echoes from the Community will continue to share stories like these, highlighting what residents are saying, why it matters, and how these insights are guiding efforts to build a more connected and compassionate Transylvania County.

      <p>Welcome back to Echoes from the Community, a column that shares insights from real stories told by residents across Transylvania County, collected through SparkPoint, a local nonprofit dedicated to strengthening community connections and well-being.</p>
      <p>Reflecting back on Hurricane Helene, many Transylvania County community members shared that they miss the time they spent device-free when internet access, cell service, and power were limited.</p>
      <p>Others echoed this sentiment, describing how even in times of destruction and loss, without constant digital distractions, they felt more present and more connected to the people right in front of them.</p>
      <p>These reflections also offer us challenges: how might we bring a little of that simplicity into our regular routines, without waiting for a crisis like Hurricane Helene to force it? Maybe this looks like choosing one device-free meal a day, taking a short walk without a phone, or setting aside a few minutes to really listen to someone we love. Small choices like these can restore the sense of presence people say they miss.</p>
      <p>Echoes from the Community will continue to share stories like these, highlighting what residents are saying, why it matters, and how these insights are guiding efforts to build a more connected and compassionate Transylvania County.

      <p>Welcome back to Echoes from the Community, a column that shares insights from real stories told by residents across Transylvania County, collected through SparkPoint, a local nonprofit dedicated to strengthening community connections and well-being.</p>
      <p>After Hurricane Helene, many Transylvania county residents have expressed a need for sustained connection and preparedness beyond the crisis. While people have spoken of being prepared with supplies and trusting their neighbors during the storm, what stands out more is the shared longing to keep that spirit alive after the crisis has passed. The tragedy of the hurricane led many to realize they are craving deeper, more meaningful relationships not only during times of disaster, but every day.</p>
      <p>One community member shared that "This crisis brought out the best in our community members. Everyone was affected, and everyone wanted to help. Most people's first reaction was to reach out and help their neighbors/fellow residents. In spite of our differences, we all shared a desire to be kind and lend support wherever and whenever we could."</p>
      <p>Another reflected, "I believe that people could benefit from understanding the importance of being prepared, but more importantly, the importance of connecting with others, loving your neighbors, being willing to serve without biases, and the importance of showing up for and being present for people that are hurting." Together, these reflections point to something bigger than disaster response. They reveal an understanding that connection itself is a form of preparedness. What would life be like if we carried this same sense of connection with us every day?</p>
      <p>Echoes from the Community invites you to join a week-long challenge: find one meaningful way to connect each day - at home, at school, at work, or in town. Try something new each day. Examples of small things you could do include saying hello to someone new, sending a thank-you text, or sharing five minutes of real conversation.</p>
      <p>These acts may seem small, but they help create lasting connections.</p>

      <p>Welcome to Echoes from the Community! This column shares insights from real stories told by residents across Transylvania County, collected through SparkPoint, a local nonprofit dedicated to strengthening community connections and well-being. These stories are gathered, analyzed, and shared to reveal the values, concerns, and hopes that shape our collective experience as a county.</p>
      <p>In the wake of Hurricane Helene, powerful emotions surfaced during recent story-sharing sessions. Despite the loss and hardship of the storm, many residents described feeling more connected than ever. "Together we can get through anything," one person said. Another added, "Never lose hope. This region is full of heroes and helpers." Again and again, gratitude flowed toward first responders and firefighters, with one community member reflecting, "Firefighters do so much more than fight fires."</p>
      <p>Across these voices, one common need emerged: more opportunities to connect with people who are different from ourselves. It's a quiet but powerful call for understanding, curiosity, and community across the lines that often divide us. One resident shared, "When your neighbor needed help, you helped. No one asked what political party you were in or what church you went to." These reflections remind us that connection itself is a form of resilience.</p>
      <p>Echoes from the Community will continue to share stories like these, highlighting what residents are saying, why it matters, and how these insights are guiding efforts to build a more connected and compassionate Transylvania County. Over the next several weeks, this column will explore emerging themes and community perspectives gathered through SparkPoint's ongoing story collection process.</p>

          <p>In the year following Hurricane Helene, SparkPoint set out to listen.</p>
          <p>In the weeks leading up to the Helene: One Year of Healing gathering, our team interviewed more than 140 people across Transylvania County — residents, volunteers, partners, and community leaders — asking a simple question: What has this year been like for you?</p>
          <p>What emerged was not a single story, but many. Stories of loss and exhaustion. Stories of generosity and resilience. Stories of neighbors meeting each other for the first time in the dark, and continuing to show up long after the lights came back on.</p>
          <p>This film is a reflection of those voices. It was created to honor the recovery journey not as a completed chapter, but as an ongoing process shaped by connection, care, and shared responsibility.</p>
          <p>Helene: One Year of Healing is offered as a tribute to the people of Transylvania County — and as a reminder that healing happens together.</p>
